Prerequisites
Before you start building your chat, make sure you have the following:

Installation and Development
Choosing a Chatbot Identity
Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. In this example, we will focus on a chatbot that offers financial health care advice. The role you choose determines the interactions and capabilities of your chat.

Log in to Hugging Face
You need an account to use the chat setup tools. If you don't have an account, registration is quick and easy.

Navigating Hug Face Spaces
Spaces are where the magic happens. This Hugable Face section allows users to seamlessly create and manage their apps. Go to [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to get started.

Create your mode
Click Create new mode to start a new mode. It is important that the name of your room reflects the role of the chat, as it helps to identify the purpose of the application immediately.

Chat Setup
Choose Frame and Template
Choose "Gradient" as your frame for user interface features and choose a suitable template like "Zephyr 7B" which is known for its versatility on multiple devices. missions

Personalization
Here you can customize the chat. Depending on the role you choose, you may want to customize the system messages and communication style. This customization allows your chat to work exactly according to its role.

Deployment
Once the installation is complete, click the Create button to deploy the chat. Installation usually takes a few minutes. After that, your chat is up and ready to interact.

Personalization Example
If you want to make your chat truly unique, consider extensive customization. For example, if you choose the "Financial Health Advisor" role:

- Modify system messages to include advice to optimize your financial situation, financial care schedules and advice on financial practices.
- Schedule a chat to recommend better financial techniques, recommend practices to improve financial health, and provide information on the benefits of good financial health.

Explore the different roles and configure the system instructions to discover the full potential of your chat. Don't forget to share your creations and experiences, because your insights can inspire others to develop their chatbots.
